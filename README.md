# Bradley-Terry-Model-v1

A matlab implementation of Bradley–Terry (BT) model [1]. BT model is the most popular approache to convert winning frequency matrix obtained from pairwise comparison (PC) experiment to quality scores (or BT scores). Typically, in PC experiments, after outlier detection, the subjective scores from the observers are represented in the wining frequency matrix and then translated to absolute quality scores using the Bradley-Terry (BT) model.
